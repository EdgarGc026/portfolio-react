Hello, this project was created to understand React, Tailwind and Storybook concepts. It is an old project that I decided to "modernize".

It was created using Node v16. Tailwind V3 and React 18

More context:
In the project you will find several folders that follow a symbology:

```
Px -> Primary
Sx -> Story
Cx -> Component
```

In PxPortfolio you can find a folder called `SxItem` (or similar), in this particular case `Sx` stands for `Secondary`

Install the React
```
npm install
```

Run the Storybook stories
```
npm run storybook
```
